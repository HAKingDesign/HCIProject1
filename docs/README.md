- Overall the design of this elevator panel is good
    - The addition of the labels to the side of the panel to provide more info helps the design
- The design lacks in some minor convinces
    - a direction indicator
    - the labels could be more obvious to which button they go to
    - the feedback on the door control could be better as the doors do not start closing immediately on pressing
    - make the order of floors a bit more obvious

- Good part of the design
    - the feedback of the lights of the buttons
    - the labels give useful information on where what is on some floors

        - though they can be kind of small
